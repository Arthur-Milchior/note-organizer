## Note Organizer Add-on for Anki

Extends Anki's card browser with a note organization interface that allows reordering notes arbitrarily through drag-and-drop/cut-and-paste. In contrast to the reposition feature, the changes by this add-on are performed on the note ID level and thus persist across reviews.
